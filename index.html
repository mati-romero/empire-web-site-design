						<h4>Infantry</h4>
						<p>
							The infantry was the branch of an army made up of soldiers trained to fight on foot. The infantrymen, colloquially referred to as "grunts", were also collectively known as ground forces. In order to survive on the battlefield, they relied on their training and equipment almost as much as they trusted each other.

						<h4>212th Strike Battalion</h4>
						<p>
							The 212th Strike Battalion was a military unit of clone troopers that served the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire. During the Clone Wars, the battalion participated in many battles under the command of Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Clone Commander Cody. When they invaded Utapau as part of the search for General Grievous, the Order 66 clone protocol was executed, leading them to betray their Jedi leader Obi-Wan Kenobi.

							Shortly after the Battle of Utapau ended, the Republic reformed into the first Galactic Empire, the 212th Battalion continuing to demonstrate their loyalty. During their days in service to the Empire, they were sent to Kashyyyk under General Kahdah to end a Wookiee revolt, in which they were successful.

						<h4>FN Corps</h4>
						<p>
							
							The FN Corps was a stormtrooper unit of the First Order Armed Forces. Before their first deployment, members of the FN Corps were trained by Captain Phasma, who believed that her unit would be the most skilled in the First Order.

							They used their vibro blades to attack their opponents and defended themselves with their blaster-proof shields.
